# CS300Project2

This project was fairly straight forward and it built on much of the coding I have learned this far this term. I used a linear sorting method to sort the classes and their 
prequisites in my file, because it was the simplest and the most straightforward of the types of sorting methods. If we had different requirements like completion time I 
would have went with one of the other sorting methods. This semester was rather difficult and really put me to the test I hope I can still pull out in the end I really need
this course and it was misfortunate I had my computer crash and have been sick with COVID the last few weeks of the course. Thank you for everythign Professor.
